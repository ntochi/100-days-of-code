# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: 7/7/20

### Today's Progress

Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Day 1-2

### Today's Progress

- Reviewed the principles of REST.
- Defined route paths for clothing store app.
- Studied CS50 Lecture 2: Arrays.

### Thoughts

Today I got to understand the principle of Stateless in REST.

In REST applications, the session state is entirely managed by the client and the request must contain all the necessary information to be understood by the server.

If the server requires a shopping cart checkout, for example, each request must contain all the information required. This will most likely look like this: /user/1234/shopping-cart or /shopping-cart?userID=1234

The point is, everything needed to process the request should be in the request.
